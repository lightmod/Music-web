    <h1>Spotify Platform Rules</h1>
<p>Spotify's mission is to unlock the potential of human creativity â€“ by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by it. We believe achieving this mission on our platform is made possible by welcoming different forms of artistic expression, ideas, perspectives, and voices. This may mean that some content on our platform may not be to each individual's liking or is content that Spotify endorses.
